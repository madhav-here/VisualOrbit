# Modern Portfolio Website

## Overview

This is a modern, responsive single-page portfolio website designed for a CS student. The application is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript with no build process required. It features a clean, minimalist design with light/dark mode support, smooth animations, and comprehensive portfolio sections including hero, about, skills, projects, timeline, and contact.

### Theme System
- **CSS Custom Properties**: Centralized theme management using CSS variables
